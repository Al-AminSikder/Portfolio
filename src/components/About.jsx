        Hello! I’m a passionate junior frontend developer who loves crafting interactive and colorful web applications. My programming journey started during high school, and I quickly fell in love with the MERN stack.<br /><br />
        I enjoy building user interfaces that are both attractive and accessible. Outside of coding, I enjoy playing football, painting, and exploring new technologies!<br /><br />
        Let’s build something amazing together!
